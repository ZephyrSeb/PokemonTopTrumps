# Pok√©mon Top Trumps

This is a project made as part of a software development course to demonstrate working knowledge of how to make an android app using android studio.\
The task was to create a top trumps game using the chosen theme. In addition to implementing the base game, I added a few additional features to the game, based on the source material, to improve replayability and balance, such as the use of item cards and mega evolution.\
From a technical perspective, I focused on making sure the game was robust to user interaction, and using android studio's animation system, everything flowed smoothly and the user experience was intuitive.
